# Beyond Nyquist â€” Research Summary & Report

This repository contains a concise summary and reflection on the research paper:
**"Beyond Nyquist: Efficient Sampling of Sparse Bandlimited Signals"**  
by Moshe Mishali and Yonina C. Eldar (IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 2009).

## Contents

- `RandomDemodulator_Beyond_Nyquist_Research_Report.ppt`: A student-authored report summarizing the main ideas, contributions, and implications of the paper.
- `Beyond Nyquist Efficient Sampling Of Sparse Bandlimited Signals.pdf`: The original research paper as provided.

## Key Concepts

- **Sub-Nyquist Sampling**: Sampling below the Nyquist rate while still achieving perfect reconstruction for sparse signals.
- **Xampling Framework**: A novel architecture combining analog preprocessing and digital reconstruction.
- **Union of Subspaces Model**: Handling signals that belong to a union of low-dimensional subspaces rather than a single one.

## Summary
This paper presents a **paradigm shift** from traditional Nyquist-rate sampling by demonstrating how sparse signals can be perfectly reconstructed using **far fewer samples**, with the help of prior knowledge about signal structure.

The presentation breaks down complex mathematical concepts from the paper into digestible slides, highlighting the motivation, architecture, and implications of this groundbreaking work.
